Project Description This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website. Designed to be a professional showcase of my skills, projects, and educational background, this site is built using modern web development practices. It is a static, multi-page site that is fully responsive and interactive, providing an engaging user experience across all devices.

The website is composed of four main pages:

Home: An introduction to my work, skills, and interests.
About: A detailed overview of my personal background, skills, and educational history.
Portfolio: A gallery of my student projects with links to their respective GitHub repositories.
Contact: A contact form and links to my professional and social profiles.
Technologies Used The website is built with a combination of standard front-end technologies and a third-party icon library.

HTML: Provides the semantic structure and content for each page, including tags.
CSS3: Handles all the styling and visual presentation. It includ
Responsive Design: Uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptive layouts that look great on any screen size.
Animations and Transitions: Implements interactive elements like hover effects, spinning icons, and subtle card movements to enhance the user experience.
JavaScript: Adds dynamic functionality, such as updating text or providing interactive features.
Font Awesome: A popular icon library that provides scalable vector icons used throughout the site (e.g., for contact links, skills, and project buttons).
